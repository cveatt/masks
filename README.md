# Face_Mask_detection

## Description
This is a face mask detection project made in Kaggle by using https://pytorch.org with https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn.html pretrained model for object detection. It helps to recognize whether there is a person in the picture wearing a medical mask or not.
## Instruction
+ Use Kaggle face mask dataset with images and annotations (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection).
+ Use FASTERRCNN_RESNET50_FPN: (https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models/generated/torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn.html) to train face mask detection project.
